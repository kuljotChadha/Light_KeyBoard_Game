## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
stackoverflow,W3 Schools,

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
The basic requirement for the project was very easy and straight forward the problem started from the bonus part of the assignemnt. The extra features required a bit extra time and some help from the online resources.
The resources helped alot in building and understanding the concept.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I have been working and learning the machine learning and other topics and was under estimating the power and area of scope of this domain.
The web development lets you put all your imagination on screen and some times makes it real.I think there are many things above and beyond that i need still need learn. There is alot apart form the head body and paragraph tag.
I need to learn alot and add skills .

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
If I had a bit more time to work on this project would have deifinetly worked on the three extra things which I have missed from the extra stuff and would have made some prefference in the difficulty of the game and would have played with some themes and sound options.
There are alot more things that can be done and make the game very fun and intresting.
